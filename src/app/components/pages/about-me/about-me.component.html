            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
                My name is Adam Poper and I am a software developer for Follett. My first exposure to programming was in 2017 when I took introduction to computer programming in high school. Since then, I have been in the constant pursuit to learn more about this field and to keep building bigger and better projects. From a young age, I have always loved building things and have always been fascinated by how things work the way that they do. Because of this, I have a unique curiosity for learning about all sorts of topics ranging from astronomy to history to computers. I tend to learn very quickly about anything that piques my interest. Software Engineering is the perfect career path for me because it gives me the tools and freedom to create and learn about whatever I want.

            <h1>Education</h1>

                I earned my Bachelor of Science in computer science from Slippery Rock University of Pennsylvania where I graduated in Spring of 2022 with magna cum laude distinction and made the dean’s list in each of the four semesters I attended. In addition to my academic standing, for my graduating class’s cap stone project in software engineering, I was the project leader in developing a simulated web-based auctioning system where I was responsible for directing each of my teammate’s contributions to the project. Also, for a semester I was given the opportunity to tutor the introduction to computer programming classes. Here, I assisted struggling students in helping them understand the advanced complexities of the C++ programming language as well as fundamental programming concepts. Prior to Slippery Rock, I achieved my Associate of Arts from Reading Area Community College on scholarship.

                Since May 2022, I have been a full stack developer for the educational technology company, Follett. The project I help develop is called Aspen. Aspen is an extremely powerful student information system used by school districts all over the country. As an Aspen team member, I have been privileged to be heavily involved in a modern and mobile friendly application for the system called Aspen Go. Since starting my career with Follett, Aspen Go has had almost all my attention. I’m proud to say that due to my team and I’s contributions to Aspen Go, it is loved by students, parents, and educators from all walks of life. Students are very easily able to view their grades, assignments, class schedule, attendance, notifications and more in a cleanly presented UI that fits very well with the mobile devices of today. Aspen Go also has robust support for online student registration for families who wish to enroll their child into the school district as well as a continuing education feature to support non-traditional students’ access to education. Follett is where I have gained the breadth of my developer experience from. The technical skills I’ve gained have been immense. In the years I’ve been developing Aspen Go, I’ve designed and implemented several UIs for many of its pages. On the backend, I’ve written several Java REST API endpoints and business logic crucial to accurately presenting all the complicated information the Aspen system supports. I’ve also been heavily involved in maintaining, iterating upon, and debugging an extremely complex template rendering system in both Java and Angular/Typescript. This templating system supports Aspen Go’s online and continuing education registration features as well as gives school districts the flexibility to create custom forms. Equally valuable to the technical skills I’ve gained from Follett have been my professional skills. Learning how to collaborate with project management to efficiently operate in an Agile development environment has been critically important to ensuring stories and defects are planned appropriately. Communication with QA is crucial, so they know what kind of edge cases to look for during testing. Smaller things that I’ve learned matter a lot include how to communicate technical information, how to ask a question, knowing when to reach out for help, and understanding the lifecycle of the software development process.
